This repository contains material related to the manuscript 'Neural signatures of stream segregation from childhood to adulthood' 
by Benocci, Alain & Calcus (for now, see https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.05.636482v1.abstract). The aim of this
project was to examine the maturation of ORN and P400 as neural signatures to stream segregation based on temporal coherence. 
We used the stochastic figure ground task to examine stream segregation based on temporal coherence. 

1) the (pre-processed) data are displayed in 20FG_Master_v5.xlsx
2) The analysis script is displayed in 20FG_Master_v5.R
3) Examples of the stimuli are displayed into Stimuli. Some contain a Figure (Figure_present_x.wav), some don't (Figure_absent_x.wav)
4) The script that was used to generate the stimuli is also shared (run_stimulus_creation)
